          Saint and Center believes in a natural high, that pure and inspired
          feeling you get when youâ€™re reaching toward your potential and helping
          others to do the same.
        </p>

        <p>
          From seed to spirit, Saint and Center was birthed out of the rhythmic
          individuality and activism of Atlanta, Georgia.
        </p>

        <p>
          Inspired by the restful contentedness of southern Sundays, creativity,
          responsibility and rebellion, we make products for personal
          transformation that support collective elevation.
        </p>

        <p>Welcome to the revival. </p>
